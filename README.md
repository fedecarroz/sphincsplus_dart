# SPHINCS+ for dart

This repository contains a Dart package that provides bindings for SPHINCS+. It provides support for all parameter sets included as part of the SPHINCS+ submission to NIST's Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization project.

## Work in progress

This package is still in the early development phase, so it should not be considered as ready to use.
